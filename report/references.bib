  abstract = {This report provides detailed description and necessary derivations for the BackPropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. BPTT is often used to learn recurrent neural networks (RNN). Contrary to feed-forward neural networks, the RNN is characterized by the ability of encoding longer past information, thus very suitable for sequential models. The BPTT extends the ordinary BP algorithm to suit the recurrent neural architecture.},
